Attend members: Orkan Kurucan, Yoav Daian, Trung Nguyen, Yamen Kassem 

During this meeting, group members discussed about how the Budget/Expense tracker program should be developed. It will be built to fulfill 
coursework's basic requirement first then other extended features can be added. All group members agreed that the future program is a console-based one,
and used by just one user who installed it.

Later, all agreed that the program needs two Class called Budget and Income. Budget class is a supercall that has other expending classes as its child classes.
This superclass allows the user to add amount of money they spent, the date when they spent as well as take note. Those child clasess help the user keep track
on which category they used their money.

Income class helps the user know what amount of income they received, the source of income as well as the date when that happended.

The user can also Add/ Edit transaction.

The program can write what the user has done from a session to a text file and read/load the content of this file for the next session

All the member will keep studying other requirements of the program and then complete the brain storming process, so the UML desigining and the software developing phases
can soon be started and delivered.
