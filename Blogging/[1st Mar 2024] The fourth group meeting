During this meeting, the source code of the program was uploaded into GitHub and the use of the first prototype was demonstrated by Trung Nguyen to all other group members.

This prototype has all the required features of the Expense/Budget tracker. It can save users works from the current session and load those data for later sessions. However, there are some bugs that need to be fixed, such as: New expense categories can be added but can’t be shown, The program can’t be turned off by its Menu.

All members agreed to continue working on the code that was shared on GitHub and fix all the bugs that might be found together.

The UML of the application will then be updated accordingly by Orkan.

The next meeting will be held on Tuesday 5th March 2024 in Cavendish Campus from 12.00
