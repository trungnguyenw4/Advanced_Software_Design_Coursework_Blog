[20th Feb 2024]

Location: Cavendish Canteen, Ground Floor, University of Westminster - Cavendish Campus
Time: 12 - 1.30
Atending: Orkan Kurucan, Yoav Daian, Trung Nguyen, Yamen Kassem [4/4]

During this meeting, based on the initial UML designed by Orkan Kurucan and Trung Nguyen, the whole team delved into the UML of the program. 
There must be classes: [Expense] Category - parent class for types of expense: Shoping, Sport, Travelling; 
                      and Transaction - parent class of [Expense] Category and Income.

The must be a Menu to prompt user with options to interact with the Program:
+addTransaction()
+editTransaction()
+deleteTransaction()
+overallSpendingCalculator()
+categorySpendingCalculator()
+setBudget()
+trackBudget()
+showTransaction()

There is a dataModel class that handles loading and saving user's input from previous sessions.

While Trung Nguyen will be doing his coding task and building program's foundation components from above Classes/features,
other members will continue working on designing other parts of program and fulfill program's ability.

The next meeting on 27th Feb 2024 will be held online since next week is the reading week and all group members will not be in London.
